# Get Rid of Those Sticks

Get Rid of Those Sticks is a game I played with my suns. 
They very much liked it. 
I very much did not like but was intrigued by the idea that actually there 
should be an optimal solution or lets call it strategy to play the game.


They game works like that: 

- there are one up to n players
- players have a set of sticks
- the first without sticks wins
- players play ona after another
- when its a players turn there is a dice throw
- the player puts her stick into the mold according to the dice throw
- if the dice shows six, the stick gets taken out of the game
- if the mold is already occupied, the player takes all sticks and its the next player's turn
- if the mold is free, the player gets to decide to throw again or pass on to the next player


Now what should be the strategy. 

- there should be a mathematical game theory solution to that 
- there should also be a way to program and simulate different strategies


... so lets build this thing and leave the math to someone else - for now. 


- Deduction
- Induction
- Game Theory
- Simulation
- Machine Learning
- AI
